# candid

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/projectname/master/images/candid.gif)

A vanilla javascript app to allow users to create a profile, set political stances, and view a list of candidates with icons to evaluate how their views align with yours. The idea of this app was to remove political parties but still give people a way to evaluate candidates.
